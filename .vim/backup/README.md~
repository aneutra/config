Awesome WM Stuff
----------------

I use awesome window manager, with the theme called 'default' in my [.config/awesome/themes/](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/awesome/themes/default)
It's not the actual default theme, but one that matches the [Jellybeans Vim theme](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim "jellybeans.vim") which I recently started using in vim.

Conky
-----

Here's what [my conky config](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/blob/master/.conkyrc) looks like. I don't use conky anymore but I like how this one looks so I'll keep the rc around for a while.

Vim
---

I listed all the plugins I use in my vimrc, since I installed them via [packer](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/packer/ "AUR - packer"). Jellybeans is the colorscheme I currently use, as mentioned above. Another great one to check out is [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme "Tomorrow Theme"). I used that one for a very long time before I switched to jellybeans. It's really an amazing scheme, I just wanted to try something different.
Yes, [my vimrc](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) is super ugly. I will clean it one day.


Misc
----

[Dina Font](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/dina-font/) is my go-to font for all my monospace needs, if anyone is wondering. It's a great font, I recommend it to everyone! It's in the Arch community repo.

Why do I have my .minecraft folder hosted here? Because uh... Why not?
